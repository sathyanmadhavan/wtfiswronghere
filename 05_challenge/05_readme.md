# Challenge_5

    While running the program it throwed an error named "missing paranthesis" in line 21.

    Tried fixing it by adding paranthesis and runned again now it throwed an error "no such file or directory"

    Checked the file name and in line 20 it is defined as "mifile" and the actual file name is "myfile" rectified the spelling mistake.

    And the program runs smoothly.
